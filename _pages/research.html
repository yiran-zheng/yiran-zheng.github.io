            <li><strong>Advertising and Consumer Decision-Making in the Experience Good Market</strong> [JMP]
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study explores the impact of brand-level information contained in media advertising on consumer decision-making when purchasing non-durable experience goods. Utilizing a random coefficient discrete-choice model on the ready-to-eat cereal industry, I consider the effects of advertising via nationwide media on consumer choices. Building on previous studies, I propose a new group of instrumental variables for addressing endogeneity and incorporating demographic household information on the consumers who purchased. I discuss strategic marketing implications for businesses, arguing that high brand awareness comes from extensive advertisements through multiple channels. The results suggest that carbohydrate-related features, in particular, need to be carefully advertised to children-orientated ready-to-eat cereal products. In addition, advertised brands have higher loyalty, and consumers are less sensitive to their prices.

            <li><strong>The Impact of Rent Stabilization Policy: An Empirical Study of Twin Cities>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study explores the impact of the rent stabilization law on the housing market using quasi-experimental methodology. Saint Paul imposed a rent stabilization policy in May 2022 regulating annual rental fee increases of no more than 3\%. Minneapolis voters approved regulating rent in 2021, but the ordinance has not been in the legislative process. Therefore, by conducting an event study model, the study explores the prospective impact of rental regulation on housing supply, stability, and quality.

            <li><strong>The Housing Market in the Sharing Economy</strong>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study explores the impact of the sharing economy Airbnb on housing prices across the country, proposing policy implications. The growth of the sharing economy has been attracting attention for years. Much literature has contributed to Airbnb's impacts on the hospitality industry, yet limited prior work has focused on the housing industry. Using a reduced-form difference-in-different model to find how new Airbnb hosts entering a neighborhood will affect local housing prices in 30 cities in the U.S. I argue that in the short term increased presence of Airbnb will reduce the housing prices, while in the long term it will increase the housing prices.
