                  <i>Abstract:</i> 
                </p> The study explores the impact of brand-level information contained in advertising on consumer decision-making when purchasing non-durable experience goods, focusing on the ready-to-eat cereal industry. Utilizing a random coefficient discrete-choice model, I consider the effects of advertising on consumer choices in nationwide broadcast media channels. The study is based on household-level and brand-level data in Texas. Consumer decision-making has been a concern for decades; I improved the model from previous studies by using a new instrument variable for addressing the endogeneity problem and using real demographic household data of consumers who purchased the products. I aim to provide strategic marketing implications for businesses, arguing that by adopting nationwide television media types for advertising, experience goods should focus on the products' awareness. The study finds that carbohydrate-related features should be carefully advertised on commercials of kids-orientated ready-to-eat cereal products. In addition, the findings also imply that consumers are less sensitive to the prices of advertised brands.
