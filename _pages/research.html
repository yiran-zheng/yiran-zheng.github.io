            <li><strong>Advertising and Consumer Decision-Making in the Experience Good Market</strong> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5099995" target="_blank">[JMP]</a>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study explores the impact of brand-level information contained in media advertising on consumer decision-making when purchasing non-durable experience goods. Utilizing a random coefficient discrete-choice model on the ready-to-eat cereal industry, I consider the effects of advertising via nationwide media on consumer choices. Building on previous studies, I propose a new group of instrumental variables for addressing endogeneity and incorporating demographic household information on the consumers who purchased. I discuss strategic marketing implications for businesses, arguing that high brand awareness comes from extensive advertisements through multiple channels. The results suggest that carbohydrate-related features, in particular, need to be carefully advertised to children-orientated ready-to-eat cereal products. In addition, advertised brands have higher loyalty, and consumers are less sensitive to their prices.

            <li><strong>The Impact of Rent Stabilization Policy: An Empirical Study of Twin Cities</strong>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study explores the impact of the rent stabilization law on the housing market using difference-in-difference model. Saint Paul, MN imposed a rent stabilization policy in May 2022 regulating annual rental fee increases of no more than 3\%. Minneapolis voters approved regulating rent in 2021, but the ordinance has not been in the legislative process. Therefore, by conducting a quasi-experimental methodology, the study explores the prospective impact of rental regulation on housing supply, stability, and quality.

            <li><strong>"Inflationary Impacts on Non Durable Good Consumption"</strong> <i>(with Ashley Escudero)</i>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> Inflationary shocks directly impact the decisions made by individual consumers regarding everyday purchasing decisions of nondurable goods that are repurchased on a regular basis. Using data from NielsenIQ this paper examines these purchasing decisions in response to the high inflation experienced in 2022 following the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining how individuals adjust their behavior in response to these increased price levels firms and policymakers can more efficiently address inflation concerns and purchasing patterns.
