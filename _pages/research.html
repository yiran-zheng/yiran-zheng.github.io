            <li><strong>Advertising and Consumer Decision-Making in the Experience Good Market</strong> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5099995" target="_blank">[JMP]</a>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study explores the impact of brand-level information contained in media advertising on consumer decision-making when purchasing non-durable experience goods. Utilizing a random coefficient discrete-choice model on the ready-to-eat cereal industry, I consider the effects of advertising via nationwide media on consumer choices. Building on previous studies, I propose a new group of instrumental variables for addressing endogeneity and incorporating demographic household information on the consumers who purchased. I discuss strategic marketing implications for businesses, arguing that high brand awareness comes from extensive advertisements through multiple channels. The results suggest that carbohydrate-related features, in particular, need to be carefully advertised to children-orientated ready-to-eat cereal products. In addition, advertised brands have higher loyalty, and consumers are less sensitive to their prices.

            <li><strong>The Impact of Rent Stabilization Policy: An Empirical Study of Twin Cities</strong>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> The study aims to test the impact of second-generation rent control, as known as rent stabilization, on the housing market in the Twin Cities by using the difference-in-difference (DiD) approach with time-geography fixed effects. Rent regulations are differentiated in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, where two cities are considered natural groups close enough to share similar demographic and geographic features, allowing exploration policy intervention on housing market indices over time. The study primarily focused on the monthly home value affected by the rent stabilization at the neighborhood level. The results suggest that rent stabilization has a significant negative effect on home values, while single-bedroom and double-bedroom houses have more substantial adverse effects than multiple-bedroom houses. The further experiment highlights that the rent stabilization causes a significant surplus of condominiums in the housing market.

            <li><strong>Inflationary Impacts on Non Durable Good Consumption</strong> <i>(with Ashley Escudero)</i>
                <p align="justify">
                  <i>Abstract:</i> Inflationary shocks directly impact the decisions made by individual consumers regarding everyday purchasing decisions of nondurable goods that are repurchased on a regular basis. Using data from NielsenIQ this paper examines these purchasing decisions in response to the high inflation experienced in 2022 following the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining how individuals adjust their behavior in response to these increased price levels firms and policymakers can more efficiently address inflation concerns and purchasing patterns.
